### The challenge

The requirement was to build the front-end for an online store, while making it look and behave as close as possible to the provided design. There were no requirements as to the used technologies, so I used this project as an opportunity to learn about Vue.js. A JSON file containing the product information was also provided, so making the website as dynamic as possible was also a focus point for me.

### Features

These are some of the features of my project:

    Different layouts depending on screen size
    Dynamic pages and components
    Cart (adding/removing products)
    Checkout form with form validation
    Local storage

### My process
#### Built with

    Vue.js

Styled with

    SCSS

### What I learned
Taking on a rather large project for my introduction to Vue.js turned out to be a good idea. This challenge not only introduced me to the basics of this framework, but also required me to research things in depth and find creative solutions. I have to say I had a lot of fun working with Vue and I'm looking forward to using it in many future projects.
